### About me

I'm a 24 year old junior data analyst, based in Nairobi, Kenya. I've always had a knack for analytical and quantitative subjects like: math, statistics, analytics and programming. I'm also interested in more creative and visual pursuits like graphic design and writing. I suppose you could say I have an insatiable curiosity. I love learning and exploring new ideas more than anything. My goal is to become better at coding and deepen my understanding of different programs and eventually build something of my own. 
You can contact me via email or on any of my social media accounts. I am particularly interested in being mentored on software engineering.  

Skills: `HTML` . `CSS` . `Canva` . `R` . `C`. `SQL`

- 🔭 I’m currently working on this page.
